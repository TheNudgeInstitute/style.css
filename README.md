# style.css

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of CSS presets to help you quickly style your web projects. The presets include common styles for typography, layout, and components.

## Purpose

The project takes the [style guide](/2022%20-%20The_Nudge%20Institute%20Brand%20Guidelines.pdf) provided by Nudge and creates CSS for it so we can use it in custom websites we create. This ensures consistency across all web projects and adheres to the design principles set by Nudge.

## Installation

To use the CSS file hosted on GitHub, link it directly in your HTML file using the raw file URL:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/TheNudgeInstitute/style.css@latest/style.min.css"
/>
```
